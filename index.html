          I'm feeling tired, really tired. There are moments when I feel
          hopeless, like I'm stuck in this never-ending cycle. I often feel so
          alone, even in a crowded room, and that's been eating away at me. I've
          become easily irritated, and it's hard to keep up with the everyday
          stuff.
          <br />
            <br />
          But here's the thing, what should I do? Where should I go from here?
          Who should I talk to? It's all a bit overwhelming, and I'm not sure
          which step to take next.
